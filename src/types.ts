/**
 * Create a POT file for a WordPress project.
 *
 * Scans PHP, Blade-PHP, and JavaScript files for translatable strings, as well as theme stylesheets and plugin files
 * if the source directory is detected as either a plugin or theme.
 *
 * @param {string} sourceDirectory - Directory to scan for string extraction.
 * @param {string} destination - Name of the resulting POT file.
 * @param {string | undefined} slug - Plugin or theme slug. Defaults to the source directory's basename.
 * @param {'plugin' | 'theme' | 'block' | 'theme-block' | 'generic'} domain - Text domain to look for in the source code,
 *   unless the `ignoreDomain` option is used. By default, the "Text Domain" header of the plugin or theme is used.
 *   If none is provided, it falls back to the project slug.
 * @param {boolean} ignoreDomain - Ignore the text domain completely and extract strings with any text domain.
 * @param {string} mergePaths - Comma-separated list of POT files whose contents should be merged with the extracted strings.
 *   If left empty, defaults to the destination POT file. POT file headers will be ignored.
 * @param {string} subtractPaths - Comma-separated list of POT files whose contents should act as some sort of denylist
 *   for string extraction. Any string which is found on that denylist will not be extracted. This can be useful when
 *   you want to create multiple POT files from the same source directory with slightly different content and no duplicate
 *   strings between them.
 * @param {boolean} subtractAndMerge - Whether source code references and comments from the generated POT file should be
 *   instead added to the POT file used for subtraction. Warning: this modifies the files passed to `subtractPaths`!
 * @param {string} includePaths - Comma-separated list of files and paths that should be used for string extraction.
 *   If provided, only these files and folders will be taken into account for string extraction.
 *   For example, `--include="src,my-file.php` will ignore anything besides `my-file.php` and files in the `src`
 *   directory. Simple glob patterns can be used, i.e. `--include=foo-*.php` includes any PHP file with the `foo-`
 *   prefix. Leading and trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `/my/directory/` is the same as `my/directory`.
 * @param {string} excludePaths - Comma-separated list of files and paths that should be skipped for string extraction.
 *   For example, `--exclude=.github,myfile.php` would ignore any strings found within `myfile.php` or the `.github`
 *   folder. Simple glob patterns can be used, i.e. `--exclude=foo-*.php` excludes any PHP file with the `foo-`
 *   prefix. Leading and trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `/my/directory/` is the same as `my/directory`.
 *   The following files and folders are always excluded: node_modules, .git, .svn, .CVS, .hg, vendor, *.min.js.
 * @param {{}} headers - Array in JSON format of custom headers which will be added to the POT file. Defaults to empty array.
 * @param {boolean} location - Whether to write `#: filename:line` lines. Defaults to true, use `--no-location`
 *   to skip the removal. Note that disabling this option makes it harder for technically skilled translators
 *   to understand each messageâ€™s context.
 * @param {boolean} skipJs - Skips JavaScript string extraction. Useful when this is done in another build step, e.g. through Babel.
 * @param {boolean} skipPhp - Skips PHP string extraction.
 * @param {boolean} skipBlade - Skips Blade-PHP string extraction.
 * @param {boolean} skipBlockJson - Skips string extraction from block.json files.
 * @param {boolean} skipThemeJson - Skips string extraction from theme.json files.
 * @param {boolean} skipAudit - Skips string audit where it tries to find possible mistakes in translatable strings.
 *   Useful when running in an automated environment.
 * @param {string} fileComment - String that should be added as a comment to the top of the resulting POT file.
 *   By default, a copyright comment is added for WordPress plugins and themes.
 * @param {string} packageName - Name to use for the package name in the resulting POT file's `Project-Id-Version` header.
 *   Overrides the plugin or theme name, if applicable.
